Git revert change 2

this is sample file 1


Inversion, like most other templating systems, works by giving you a way of defining the static parts of your output, and then letting you combine that at a later point with the dynamic parts:

this is stash lecture, change in fiel2
this is stash lecture, change in fiel1
this is stash lecture, change for untracked files in fiel1
